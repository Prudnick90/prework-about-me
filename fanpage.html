    <h1>Coheed and Cambria Fans Unite!</h1>
    <p>
        Coheed and Cambria has changed the music game for me! They were the band that flipped the music scene on its head and threw me into the world of prgressive rock/metal.
    </p>
    
    <p>The band originally was named Shabutie and then changed their name to Coheed and Cambria. Claudia is the mastermind to all their music and every song correlates to a Sci-Fi novel he wrote called the Armory Wars.</p>
